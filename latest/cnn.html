The average resolution of images in <a href="http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014">ILSVRC</a> is 482x415, with three channels (RGB) this makes the typical input size 482x415x3=600,090. Each hidden unit connected to the input in a multilayer perceptron would have 600K parameters, a single hidden layer of size 1000 would have 600 million parameters. Too many parameters cause two types of problems: (1) today&#39;s GPUs have limited amount of memory (4G-12G) and large networks fill them up quickly. (2) models with a large number of parameters are difficult to train without overfitting: we need a lot of data, strong regularization, and/or a good initialization to learn with large models.</p><p>One problem with the MLP is that it is fully connected: every hidden unit is connected to every input pixel. The model does not assume any spatial relationships between pixels, in fact we can permute all the pixels in an image and the performance of the MLP would be the same! We could instead have an architecture where each hidden unit is connected to a small patch of the image, say 40x40. Each such locally connected hidden unit would have 40x40x3=4800 parameters instead of 600K. For the price (in memory) of one fully connected hidden unit, we could have 125 of these locally connected mini-hidden-units with receptive fields spread around the image.</p><p>The second problem with the MLP is that it does not take advantage of the symmetry in the problem: a cat in the lower right corner of the image is going to be similar to a cat in the lower left corner. This means the local hidden units looking at these two patches can share identical weights. We can take one 40x40 cat filter and apply it to each 40x40 patch in the image taking up only 4800 parameters.</p><p>A <strong>convolutional neural network</strong> (aka CNN or ConvNet) combines these two ideas and uses operations that are local and that share weights. CNNs commonly use three types of operations: convolution, pooling, and normalization which we describe next.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Convolution-1" href="#Convolution-1">Convolution</a></h2><p><strong>Convolution in 1-D</strong></p><p>Let <span>$w, x$</span> be two 1-D vectors with <span>$W, X$</span> elements respectively. In our examples, we will assume x is the input (consider it a 1-D image) and w is a filter (aka kernel) with <span>$W&lt;X$</span>. The 1-D convolution operation <span>$y=w\ast x$</span> results in a vector with <span>$Y=X-W+1$</span> elements defined as:</p><div>\[y_k \equiv \sum_{i+j=k+W} x_i w_j\]</div><p>or equivalently</p><div>\[y_k \equiv \sum_{i=k}^{k+W-1} x_i w_{k+W-i}\]</div><p>where <span>$i\in[1,X], j\in[1,W], k\in[1,Y]$</span>. We get each entry in y by multiplying pairs of matching entries in x and w and summing the results. Matching entries in x and w are the ones whose indices add up to a constant. This can be visualized as flipping w, sliding it over x, and at each step writing their dot product into a single entry in y. Here is an example in Julia you should be able to calculate by hand:</p><pre><code class="language- sourceCode">julia&gt; w = KnetArray(reshape([1.0,2.0,3.0], (3,1,1,1)))
3×1×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}: [1,2,3]
julia&gt; x = KnetArray(reshape([1.0:7.0...], (7,1,1,1)))
7×1×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
julia&gt; y = conv4(w, x)
5×1×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}: [10,16,22,28,34]</code></pre><p><code>conv4</code> is the convolution operation in Knet (based on the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn">CUDNN</a> implementation). For reasons that will become clear it works with 4-D and 5-D arrays, so we reshape our 1-D input vectors by adding extra singleton dimensions at the end. The convolution of w=[1,2,3] and x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] gives y=[10,16,22,28,34]. For example, the third element of y, 22, can be obtained by reversing w to [3,2,1] and taking its dot product starting with the third element of x, [3,4,5].</p><p><strong>Padding</strong></p><p>In the last example, the input x had 7 dimensions, the output y had 5. In image processing applications we typically want to keep x and y the same size. For this purpose we can provide a <code>padding</code> keyword argument to the <code>conv4</code> operator. If padding=k, x will be assumed padded with k zeros on the left and right before the convolution, e.g. padding=1 means treat x as [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0]. The default padding is 0. For inputs in D-dimensions we can specify padding with a D-tuple, e.g. <code>padding=(1,2)</code> for 2D, or a single number, e.g. <code>padding=1</code> which is shorthand for <code>padding=(1,1)</code>. The result will have <span>$Y=X+2P-W+1$</span> elements where <span>$P$</span> is the padding size. Therefore to preserve the size of x when W=3 we should use padding=1.</p><pre><code class="language- sourceCode">julia&gt; y = conv4(w, x; padding=(1,0))
7×1×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}: [4,10,16,22,28,34,32]</code></pre><p>For example, to calculate the first entry of y, take the dot product of the inverted w, [3,2,1] with the first three elements of the padded x, [0 1 2]. You can see that in order to preserve the input size, <span>$Y=X$</span>, given a filter size <span>$W$</span>, the padding should be set to <span>$P=(W-1)/2$</span>. This will work if W is odd.</p><p><strong>Stride</strong></p><p>In the preceding examples we shift the inverted w by one position after each dot product. In some cases you may want to skip two or more positions. The amount of skip is set by the <code>stride</code> keyword argument of the <code>conv4</code> operation (the default stride is 1). In the following example we set stride to W such that the consecutive filter applications are non-overlapping:</p><pre><code class="language- sourceCode">julia&gt; y = conv4(w, x; padding=(1,0), stride=3)
3×1×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}: [4,22,32]</code></pre><p>Note that the output has the first, middle, and last values of the previous example, i.e. every third value is kept and the rest are skipped. In general if stride=S and padding=P, the size of the output will be:</p><div>\[Y = 1 + \left\lfloor\frac{X+2P-W}{S}\right\rfloor\]</div><p><strong>Mode</strong></p><p>The convolution operation we have used so far flips the convolution kernel before multiplying it with the input. To take our first 1-D convolution example with</p><div>\[y_1 = x_1 w_W + x_2 w_{W-1} + x_3 w_{W-2} + \ldots \\
y_2 = x_2 w_W + x_3 w_{W-1} + x_4 w_{W-2} + \ldots \\
\ldots\]</div><p>We could also perform a similar operation without kernel flipping:</p><div>\[y_1 = x_1 w_1 + x_2 w_2 + x_3 w_3 + \ldots \\
y_2 = x_2 w_1 + x_3 w_2 + x_4 w_3 + \ldots \\
\ldots\]</div><p>This variation is called cross-correlation. The two modes are specified in Knet by choosing one of the following as the value of the <code>mode</code> keyword:</p><ul><li><p><code>0</code> for convolution</p></li><li><p><code>1</code> for cross-correlation</p></li></ul><p>This option would be important if we were hand designing our filters. However the mode does not matter for CNNs where the filters are learnt from data, the CNN will simply learn an inverted version of the filter if necessary.</p><p><strong>More Dimensions</strong></p><p>When the input x has multiple dimensions convolution is defined similarly. In particular the filter w has the same number of dimensions but typically smaller size. The convolution operation flips w in each dimension and slides it over x, calculating the sum of elementwise products at every step. The formulas we have given above relating the output size to the input and filter sizes, padding and stride parameters apply independently for each dimension.</p><p>Knet supports 2D and 3D convolutions. The inputs and the filters have two extra dimensions at the end which means we use 4D and 5D arrays for 2D and 3D convolutions. Here is a 2D convolution example:</p><pre><code class="language- sourceCode">julia&gt; w = KnetArray(reshape([1.0:4.0...], (2,2,1,1)))
2×2×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}:
[:, :, 1, 1] =
 1.0  3.0
 2.0  4.0
julia&gt; x = KnetArray(reshape([1.0:9.0...], (3,3,1,1)))
3×3×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}:
[:, :, 1, 1] =
 1.0  4.0  7.0
 2.0  5.0  8.0
 3.0  6.0  9.0
julia&gt; y = conv4(w, x)
2×2×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}:
[:, :, 1, 1] =
 23.0  53.0
 33.0  63.0</code></pre><p>To see how this result comes about, note that when you flip w in both dimensions you get:</p><pre><code class="language-none">4 2
3 1</code></pre><p>Multiplying this elementwise with the upper left corner of x:</p><pre><code class="language-none">1 4
2 5</code></pre><p>and adding the results gives you the first entry 23.</p><p>The padding and stride options work similarly in multiple dimensions and can be specified as tuples: padding=(1,2) means a padding width of 1 along the first dimension and 2 along the second dimension for a 2D convolution. You can use padding=1 as a shorthand for padding=(1,1).</p><p><strong>Multiple filters</strong></p><p>So far we have been ignoring the extra dimensions at the end of our convolution arrays. Now we are ready to put them to use. A D-dimensional input image is typically represented as a D+1 dimensional array with dimensions:</p><div>\[[ X_1, \ldots, X_D, C ]\]</div><p>The first D dimensions <span>$X_1\ldots X_D$</span> determine the spatial extent of the image. The last dimension <span>$C$</span> is the number of channels (aka slices, frames, maps, filters). The definition and number of channels is application dependent. We use C=3 for RGB images representing the intensity in three colors: red, green, and blue. For grayscale images we have a single channel, C=1. If you were developing a model for chess, we could have C=12, each channel representing the locations of a different piece type.</p><p>In an actual CNN we do not typically hand-code the filters. Instead we tell the network: &quot;here are 1000 randomly initialized filters, you go ahead and turn them into patterns useful for my task.&quot; This means we usually work with banks of multiple filters simultaneously and GPUs have optimized operations for such filter banks. The dimensions of a typical filter bank are:</p><div>\[[ W_1, \ldots, W_D, I, O ]\]</div><p>The first D dimensions <span>$W_1\ldots W_D$</span> determine the spatial extent of the filters. The next dimension <span>$I$</span> is the number of input channels, i.e. the number of filters from the previous layer, or the number of color channels of the input image. The last dimension <span>$O$</span> is the number of output channels, i.e. the number of filters in this layer.</p><p>If we take an input of size <span>$[X_1,\ldots, X_D,I]$</span> and apply a filter bank of size <span>$[W_1,\ldots,W_D,I,O]$</span> using padding <span>$[P_1,\ldots,P_D]$</span> and stride <span>$[S_1,\ldots,S_D]$</span> the resulting array will have dimensions:</p><div>\[[ W_1, \ldots, W_D, I, O ] \ast [ X_1, \ldots, X_D, I ] 
\Rightarrow [ Y_1, \ldots, Y_D, O ] \\
\mbox{where } Y_i = 1 + \left\lfloor\frac{X_i+2P_i-W_i}{S_i}\right\rfloor\]</div><p>As an example let&#39;s start with an input image of 256x256 pixels and 3 RGB channels. We&#39;ll first apply 25 filters of size 5x5 and padding=2, then 50 filters of size 3x3 and padding=1, and finally 75 filters of size 3x3 and padding=1. Here are the dimensions we will get:</p><div>\[[ 256, 256, 3 ] \ast [ 5, 5, 3, 25 ] \Rightarrow [ 256, 256, 25 ] \\
[ 256, 256, 25] \ast [ 3, 3, 25,50 ] \Rightarrow [ 256, 256, 50 ] \\
[ 256, 256, 50] \ast [ 3, 3, 50,75 ] \Rightarrow [ 256, 256, 75 ]\]</div><p>Note that the number of input channels of the input data and the filter bank always match. In other words, a filter covers only a small part of the spatial extent of the input but all of its channel depth.</p><p><strong>Multiple instances</strong></p><p>In addition to processing multiple filters in parallel, we will want to implement CNNs with minibatching, i.e. process multiple inputs in parallel. A minibatch of D-dimensional images is represented as a D+2 dimensional array:</p><div>\[[ X_1, \ldots, X_D, I, N ]\]</div><p>where I is the number of channels as before, and N is the number of images in a minibatch. The convolution implementation in Knet/CUDNN use D+2 dimensional arrays for both images and filters. We used 1 for the extra dimensions in our first examples, in effect using a single channel and a single image minibatch.</p><p>If we apply a filter bank of size <span>$[W_1, \ldots, W_D, I, O]$</span> to the minibatch given above the output size would be:</p><div>\[[ W_1, \ldots, W_D, I, O ] \ast [ X_1, \ldots, X_D, I, N ] 
\Rightarrow [ Y_1, \ldots, Y_D, O, N ] \\
\mbox{where } Y_i = 1 + \left\lfloor\frac{X_i+2P_i-W_i}{S_i}\right\rfloor\]</div><p>If we used a minibatch size of 128 in the previous example with 256x256 images, the sizes would be:</p><div>\[[ 256, 256, 3, 128 ] \ast [ 5, 5, 3, 25 ] \Rightarrow [ 256, 256, 25, 128 ] \\
[ 256, 256, 25, 128] \ast [ 3, 3, 25,50 ] \Rightarrow [ 256, 256, 50, 128 ] \\
[ 256, 256, 50, 128] \ast [ 3, 3, 50,75 ] \Rightarrow [ 256, 256, 75, 128 ]\]</div><p>basically adding an extra dimension of 128 at the end of each data array.</p><p>By the way, the arrays in this particular example already exceed 5GB of storage, so you would want to use a smaller minibatch size if you had a K20 GPU with 4GB of RAM.</p><p>Note: All the dimensions given above are for column-major languages like Julia. CUDNN uses row-major notation, so all the dimensions would be reversed, e.g. <span>$[N,I,X_D,\ldots,X_1]$</span>.</p><p><strong>Convolution vs matrix multiplication</strong></p><p>Convolution can be turned into a matrix multiplication, where certain entries in the matrix are constrained to be the same. The motivation is to be able to use efficient algorithms for matrix multiplication in order to perform convolution. The drawback is the large amount of memory needed due to repeated entries or sparse representations.</p><p>Here is a matrix implementation for our first convolution example <span>$w=[1\ldots 3],\,\,x=[1\ldots 7],\,\,w\ast x = [10,16,22,28,34]$</span>:</p><blockquote><p><img src="images/im2col1a.jpg" alt="image"/></p></blockquote><p>In this example we repeated the entries of the filter on multiple rows of a sparse matrix with shifted positions. Alternatively we can repeat the entries of the input to place each local patch on a separate column of an input matrix:</p><blockquote><p><img src="images/im2col1b.jpg" alt="image"/></p></blockquote><p>The first approach turns w into a <span>$Y\times X$</span> sparse matrix, wheras the second turns x into a <span>$W\times Y$</span> dense matrix.</p><p>For 2-D images, typically the second approach is used: the local patches of the image used by convolution are stretched out to columns of an input matrix, an operation commonly called <code>im2col</code>. Each convolutional filter is stretched out to rows of a filter matrix. After the matrix multiplication the resulting array is reshaped into the proper output dimensions. The following figure illustrates these operations on a small example:</p><blockquote><p><img src="images/im2col2.jpg" alt="image"/></p></blockquote><p>It is also possible to go in the other direction, i.e. implement matrix multiplication (i.e. a fully connected layer) in terms of convolution. This conversion is useful when we want to build a network that can be applied to inputs of different sizes: the matrix multiplication would fail, but the convolution will give us outputs of matching sizes. Consider a fully connected layer with a weight matrix W of size <span>$K\times D$</span> mapping a D-dimensional input vector x to a K-dimensional output vector y. We can consider each of the K rows of the W matrix a convolution filter. The following example shows how we can reshape the arrays and use convolution for matrix multiplication:</p><pre><code class="language-none">julia&gt; using Knet
julia&gt; x = KnetArray(reshape([1.0:3.0...], (3,1)))

However it does get us representational and statistical efficiency, i.e. the functions we would like to approximate are often expressed with significantly fewer parameters using convolutional layers and thus require fewer examples to train.</p><p><strong>Backpropagation</strong></p><p>Convolution is a linear operation consisting of additions and multiplications, so its backward pass is not very complicated except for the indexing. Just like the backward pass for matrix multiplication can be expressed as another matrix multiplication, the backward pass for convolution (at least if we use stride=1) can be expressed as another convolution. We will derive the backward pass for a 1-D example using the cross-correlation mode (no kernel flipping) to keep things simple. We will denote the cross-correlation operation with <span>$\star$</span> to distinguish it from convolution denoted with <span>$\ast$</span>. Here are the individual entries of <span>$y=w\star x$</span>:</p><div>\[y_1 = x_1 w_1 + x_2 w_2 + x_3 w_3 + \ldots \\
y_2 = x_2 w_1 + x_3 w_2 + x_4 w_3 + \ldots \\
y_3 = x_3 w_1 + x_4 w_2 + x_5 w_3 + \ldots \\
\ldots\]</div><p>As you can see, because of weight sharing the same w entry is used in computing multiple y entries. This means a single w entry effects the objective function through multiple paths and these effects need to be added. Denoting <span>$\partial J/\partial y_i$</span> as <span>$y_i&#39;$</span> for brevity we have:</p><div>\[w_1&#39; = x_1 y_1&#39; + x_2 y_2&#39; + \ldots \\
w_2&#39; = x_2 y_1&#39; + x_3 y_2&#39; + \ldots \\
w_3&#39; = x_3 y_1&#39; + x_4 y_2&#39; + \ldots \\
\ldots \\\]</div><p>which can be recognized as another cross-correlation operation, this time between <span>$x$</span> and <span>$y&#39;$</span>. This allows us to write <span>$w&#39;=y&#39;\star x$</span>.</p><p>Alternatively, we can use the equivalent matrix multiplication operation from the last section to derive the backward pass:</p><blockquote><p><img src="images/xcor-im2col-forw.jpg" alt="image"/></p></blockquote><p>If <span>$r$</span> is the matrix with repeated <span>$x$</span> entries in this picture, we have <span>$y=wr$</span>. Remember that the backward pass for matrix multiplication <span>$y=wr$</span> is <span>$w&#39;=y&#39;r^T$</span>:</p><blockquote><p><img src="images/xcor-im2col-back.jpg" alt="image"/></p></blockquote><p>which can be recognized as the matrix multiplication equivalent of the cross correlation operation <span>$w&#39;=y&#39;\star x$</span>.</p><p>Here is the gradient for the input:</p><div>\[\begin{align*}
&amp; x_1&#39; = w_1 y_1&#39; \\
&amp; x_2&#39; = w_2 y_1&#39; + w_1 y_2&#39; \\
&amp; x_3&#39; = w_3 y_1&#39; + w_2 y_2&#39; + w_1 y_3&#39; \\
&amp; \ldots
\end{align*}\]</div><p>You can recognize this as a regular convolution between <span>$w$</span> and <span>$y&#39;$</span> with some zero padding.</p><p>The following resources provide more detailed derivations of the backward pass for convolution:</p><ul><li><p><a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/convolution.pdf">Goodfellow, I.

Pooling looks at small windows of the input, and computes a single summary statistic, e.g. maximum or average, for each window. A pooling layer basically says: tell me whether this feature exists in a certain region of the image, I don&#39;t care exactly where. This makes the output of the layer invariant to small translations of the input. Pooling layers use large strides, typically as large as the window size, which reduces the size of their output.</p><p>Like convolution, pooling slides a small window of a given size over the input optionally padded with zeros skipping stride pixels every step. In Knet by default there is no padding, the window size is 2, stride is equal to the window size and the pooling operation is max. These default settings reduce each dimension of the input to half the size.</p><p><strong>Pooling in 1-D</strong></p><p>Here is a 1-D example:</p><pre><code class="language- sourceCode">julia&gt; x = KnetArray(reshape([1.0:6.0...], (6,1,1,1)))
6×1×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
julia&gt; pool(x)
3×1×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}: [2,4,6]</code></pre><p>With window size and stride equal to 2, pooling considers the input windows <span>$[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]$</span> and picks the maximum in each window.</p><p><strong>Window</strong></p><p>The default and most commonly used window size is 2, however other window sizes can be specified using the <code>window</code> keyword. For D-dimensional inputs the size can be specified using a D-tuple, e.g. <code>window=(2,3)</code> for 2-D, or a single number, e.g. <code>window=3</code> which is shorthand for <code>window=(3,3)</code> in 2-D. Here is an example using a window size of 3 instead of the default 2:</p><pre><code class="language- sourceCode">julia&gt; x = KnetArray(reshape([1.0:6.0...], (6,1,1,1)))
6×1×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
julia&gt; pool(x; window=3)
2×1×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}: [3, 6]</code></pre><p>With a window and stride of 3 (the stride is equal to window size by default), pooling considers the input windows <span>$[1,2,3],[4,5,6]$</span>, and writes the maximum of each window to the output. If the input size is <span>$X$</span>, and stride is equal to the window size <span>$W$</span>, the output will have <span>$Y=\lfloor X/W\rfloor$</span> elements.</p><p><strong>Padding</strong></p><p>The amount of zero padding is specified using the <code>padding</code> keyword argument just like convolution. Padding is 0 by default. For D-dimensional inputs padding can be specified as a tuple such as <code>padding=(1,2)</code>, or a single number <code>padding=1</code> which is shorthand for <code>padding=(1,1)</code> in 2-D. Here is a 1-D example:</p><pre><code class="language- sourceCode">julia&gt; x = KnetArray(reshape([1.0:6.0...], (6,1,1,1)))
6×1×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

julia&gt; pool(x; padding=(1,0))
4×1×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}: [1,3,5,6]</code></pre><p>In this example, window=stride=2 by default and the padding size is 1, so the input is treated as <span>$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,0]$</span> and split into windows of <span>$[0,1],[2,3],[4,5],[6,0]$</span> and the maximum of each window is written to the output.</p><p>With padding size <span>$P$</span>, if the input size is <span>$X$</span>, and stride is equal to the window size <span>$W$</span>, the output will have <span>$Y=\lfloor (X+2P)/W\rfloor$</span> elements.</p><p><strong>Stride</strong></p><p>The pooling stride is equal to the window size by default (as opposed to the convolution case, where it is 1 by default). This is most common in practice but other strides can be specified using tuples e.g. <code>stride=(1,2)</code> or numbers e.g. <code>stride=1</code>. Here is a 1-D example with a stride of 4 instead of the default 2:</p><pre><code class="language- sourceCode">julia&gt; x = KnetArray(reshape([1.0:10.0...], (10,1,1,1)))
10×1×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

julia&gt; pool(x; stride=4)
4×1×1×1 Knet.KnetArray{Float64,4}: [2, 6, 10]</code></pre><p>In general, when we have an input of size <span>$X$</span> and pool with window size <span>$W$</span>, padding <span>$P$</span>, and stride <span>$S$</span>, the size of the output will be:</p><div>\[Y = 1 + \left\lfloor\frac{X+2P-W}{S}\right\rfloor\]</div><p><strong>Pooling operations</strong></p><p>There are three pooling operations defined by CUDNN used for summarizing each window:</p><ul><li><p><code>CUDNN_POOLING_MAX</code></p></li><li><p><code>CUDNN_POOLING_AVERAGE_COUNT_INCLUDE_PADDING</code></p></li><li><p><code>CUDNN_POOLING_AVERAGE_COUNT_EXCLUDE_PADDING</code></p></li></ul><p>These options can be specified as the value of the <code>mode</code> keyword argument to the <code>pool</code> operation. The default is <code>0</code> (max pooling) which we have been using so far. The last two compute averages, and differ in whether to include or exclude the padding zeros in these averages. <code>mode</code> should be <code>1</code> for averaging including padding, and <code>2</code> for averaging excluding padding. For example, with input <span>$x=[1,2,3,4,5,6]$</span>, <code>window=stride=2</code>, and <code>padding=1</code> we have the following outputs with the three options:</p><pre><code class="language-none">mode=0 =&gt; [1,3,5,6]
mode=1 =&gt; [0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 3.0]
mode=2 =&gt; [1.0, 2.5, 4.5, 6.0]</code></pre><p><strong>More Dimensions</strong></p><p>D-dimensional inputs are pooled with D-dimensional windows, the size of each output dimension given by the 1-D formulas above. Here is a 2-D example with default options, i.e. window=stride=(2,2), padding=(0,0), mode=max:</p><pre><code class="language-none">julia&gt; x = KnetArray(reshape([1.0:16.0...], (4,4,1,1)))

Here is an example with two channels:</p><pre><code class="language-none">julia&gt; x = KnetArray(rand(4,4,2,1))

In this section we summarize common patterns of usage in recent work based on <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks">(Karpathy, 2016)</a>.</p><ul><li><p>The operations in convolutional networks are usually ordered into   several layers of convolution-bias-activation-pooling sequences.   Note that the convolution-bias-activation sequence is an efficient   way to implement the common neural net function <span>$f(wx+b)$</span> for a   locally connected and weight sharing hidden layer.</p></li><li><p>The convolutional layers are typically followed by a number of fully   connected layers that end with a softmax layer for prediction (if we   are training for a classification problem).</p></li><li><p>It is preferrable to have multiple convolution layers with small   filter sizes rather than a single layer with a large filter size.   Consider three convolutional layers with a filter size of   3x3. The units in the top layer have receptive fields of   size 7x7. Compare this with a single layer with a filter   size of 7x7. The three layer architecture has two   advantages: The units in the single layer network is restricted to   linear decision boundaries, whereas the three layer network can be   more expressive. Second, if we assume C channels, the parameter   tensor for the single layer network has size <span>$[7,7,C,C]$</span> whereas the   three layer network has three tensors of size <span>$[3,3,C,C]$</span> i.e. a   smaller number of parameters. The one disadvantage of the three   layer network is the extra storage required to store the   intermediate results for backpropagation.</p></li><li><p>Thus common settings for convolution use 3x3 filters with   <code>stride = padding = 1</code> (which incidentally preserves the input   size). The one exception may be a larger filter size used in the   first layer which is applied to the image pixels. This will save   memory when the input is at its largest, and linear functions may be   sufficient to express the low level features at this stage.</p></li><li><p>The pooling operation may not be present in every layer. Keep in   mind that pooling destroys information and having several   convolutional layers without pooling may allow more complex features   to be learnt. When pooling is present it is best to keep the window   size small to minimize information loss. The common settings for   pooling are <code>window = stride = 2, padding = 0</code>, which halves the   input size in each dimension.</p></li></ul><p>Beyond these general guidelines, you should look at the architectures used by successful models in the literature.
