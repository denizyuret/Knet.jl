  about REINFORCE and more generally Reinforcement Learning and policy
  gradient methods (which REINFORCE is a special case of) David
  Silver's class, or one of Pieter Abbeel's classes.  This is very
  much ongoing work but these hard attention models have been
  explored, for example, in Inferring Algorithmic Patterns with
  Stack-Augmented Recurrent Nets, Reinforcement Learning Neural Turing
  Machines, and Show Attend and Tell.

  information about reinforcement learning, and Mnih et al.(2013) for
  the deep learning approach to reinforcement learning.
