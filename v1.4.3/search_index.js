Given a minibatch of sequences x, rnn(x) returns y, the hidden states of the final layer for each time step. rnn.h and rnn.c fields can be used to set the initial hidden states and read the final hidden states of all layers.  Note that the final time step of y always contains the final hidden state of the last layer, equivalent to rnn.h for a single layer network.\n\nDimensions: The input x can be 1, 2, or 3 dimensional and y will have the same number of dimensions as x. size(x)=(X,[B,T]) and size(y)=(H/2H,[B,T]) where X is inputSize, B is batchSize, T is seqLength, H is hiddenSize, 2H is for bidirectional RNNs. By default a 1-D x represents a single instance for a single time step, a 2-D x represents a single minibatch for a single time step, and a 3-D x represents a sequence of identically sized minibatches for multiple time steps. The output y gives the hidden state (of the final layer for multi-layer RNNs) for each time step. The fields rnn.h and rnn.c represent the hidden states of all layers in a single time step and have size (H,B,L/2L) where L is numLayers and 2L is for bidirectional RNNs.\n\nbatchSizes: If batchSizes=nothing (default), all sequences in a minibatch are assumed to be the same length. If batchSizes is an array of (non-increasing) integers, it gives us the batch size for each time step (allowing different sequences in the minibatch to have different lengths). In this case x will typically be 2-D with the second dimension representing variable size batches for time steps. If batchSizes is used, sum(batchSizes) should equal length(x) ÷ size(x,1). When the batch size is different in every time step, hidden states will have size (H,B,L/2L) where B is always the size of the first (largest) minibatch.\n\nHidden states: The hidden and cell states are kept in rnn.h and rnn.c fields (the cell state is only used by LSTM). They can be initialized during construction using the h and c keyword arguments, or modified later by direct assignment. Valid values are nothing (default), 0, or an array of the right type and size possibly wrapped in a Param. If the value is nothing the initial state is assumed to be zero and the final state is discarded keeping the value nothing. If the value is 0 the initial state is assumed to be zero and 0 is replaced by the final state on return. If the value is a valid state, it is used as the initial state and is replaced by the final state on return.\n\nIn a differentiation context the returned final hidden states will be wrapped in Result types. This is necessary if the same RNN object is to be called multiple times in a single iteration. Between iterations (i.e. after diff/update) the hidden states need to be unboxed with e.g. rnn.h = value(rnn.h) to prevent spurious dependencies. This happens automatically during the backward pass for GPU RNNs but needs to be done manually for CPU RNNs.

Any function that produces values from an iterator can be used with such an object, e.g. progress!(sgd(f,d)) iterates the sgd optimizer and displays a progress bar. For convenience, appending ! to the name of the function iterates and returns nothing, i.e. sgd!(...) is equivalent to (for x in sgd(...) end).\n\nWe define optimizers as lazy iterators to have explicit control over them:\n\nTo report progress use progress(sgd(f,d)).\nTo run until convergence use converge(sgd(f,cycle(d))).\nTo run multiple epochs use sgd(f,repeat(d,n)).\nTo run a given number of iterations use sgd(f,take(cycle(d),n)).\nTo do a task every n iterations use (task() for (i,j) in enumerate(sgd(f,d)) if i%n == 1).\n\nThese functions apply the same algorithm with the same configuration to every parameter by default. minimize takes an explicit optimizer argument, all others call minimize with an appropriate optimizer argument (see @doc update! for a list of possible optimizers). Before calling update! on a Param, minimize sets its opt field to a copy of this default optimizer if it is not already set. The opt field is used by the update! function to determine the type of update performed on that parameter.  If you need finer grained control, you can set the optimizer of an individual Param by setting its opt field before calling one of these functions. They will not override the opt field if it is already set, e.g. sgd(model,data) will perform an Adam update for a parameter whose opt field is an Adam object. This also means you can stop and start the training without losing optimization state, the first call will set the opt fields and the subsequent calls will not override them.\n\nGiven a parameter w and its gradient g here are the updates applied by each optimizer:\n\n# sgd (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent)\nw .= w - lr * g\n\n# momentum (http://jlmelville.github.io/mize/nesterov.html)\nv .= gamma * v - lr * g\nw .= w + v\n\n# nesterov (http://jlmelville.github.io/mize/nesterov.html)\nw .= w - gamma * v\nv .= gamma * v - lr * g\nw .= w + (1 + gamma) * v\n\n# adagrad (http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v12/duchi11a.html)\nG .= G + g .^ 2\nw .= w - lr * g ./ sqrt(G + eps)\n\n# rmsprop (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf)\nG .= rho * G + (1-rho) * g .^ 2 \nw .= w - lr * g ./ sqrt(G + eps)\n\n# adadelta (http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5701)\nG .= rho * G + (1-rho) * g .^ 2\nupdate = sqrt(delta + eps) .* g ./ sqrt(G + eps)\nw = w - lr * update\ndelta = rho * delta + (1-rho) * update .^ 2\n\n# adam (http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980)\nv = beta1 * v + (1 - beta1) * g\nG = beta2 * G + (1 - beta2) * g .^ 2\nvhat = v ./ (1 - beta1 ^ t)\nGhat = G ./ (1 - beta2 ^ t)\nw = w - (lr / (sqrt(Ghat) + eps)) * vhat\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"reference/#Knet.Train20.converge","page":"Reference","title":"Knet.Train20.converge","text":"converge(itr; alpha=0.1)\n\nReturn an iterator which acts exactly like itr, but quits when values from itr stop decreasing. itr should produce numeric values.\n\nIt can be used to train a model with the data cycled:\n\nprogress!(converge(minimize(model,cycle(data))))\n\nalpha controls the exponential average of values to detect convergence.

Non-differentiable functions such as sign, and non-numeric functions such as size should be defined using the @zerograd macro instead.\n\nExamples\n\n@primitive sin(x::Number)\n@primitive hypot(x1,x2),dy,y\n\n@primitive sin(x::Number),dy  (dy.*cos(x))\n@primitive hypot(x1,x2),dy,y  (dy.*x1./y)  (dy.*x2./y)\n\nThe first example shows that fx is a typed method declaration.  Julia supports multiple dispatch, i.e. a single function can have multiple methods with different arg types. AutoGrad takes advantage of this and supports multiple dispatch for primitives and gradients.\n\nThe second example specifies variable names for the output gradient dy and the output y after the method declaration which can be used in gradient expressions.  Untyped, ellipsis and keyword arguments are ok as in f(a::Int,b,c...;d=1).  Parametric methods such as f(x::T) where {T<:Number} cannot be used.\n\nThe method declaration can optionally be followed by gradient expressions.  The third and fourth examples show how gradients can be specified.  Note that the parameters, the return variable and the output gradient of the original function can be used in the gradient expressions.\n\nUnder the hood\n\nThe @primitive macro turns the first example into:\n\nsin(x::Value{T}) where {T<:Number} = forw(sin, x)\n\nThis will cause calls to sin with a boxed argument (Value{T<:Number}) to be recorded. The recorded operations are used by AutoGrad to construct a dynamic computational graph. With multiple arguments things are a bit more complicated.  Here is what happens with the second example:\n\nhypot(x1::Value{S}, x2::Value{T}) where {S,T} = forw(hypot, x1, x2)\nhypot(x1::S, x2::Value{T})        where {S,T} = forw(hypot, x1, x2)\nhypot(x1::Value{S}, x2::T)        where {S,T} = forw(hypot, x1, x2)\n\nWe want the forw method to be called if any one of the arguments is a boxed Value.  There is no easy way to specify this in Julia, so the macro generates all 2^N-1 boxed/unboxed argument combinations.\n\nIn AutoGrad, gradients are defined using gradient methods that have the following pattern:\n\nback(f,Arg{i},dy,y,x...) => dx[i]\n\nFor the third example here is the generated gradient method:\n\nback(::typeof(sin), ::Type{Arg{1}}, dy, y, x::Value{T}) where {T<:Number} = dy .* cos(x)\n\nFor the last example a different gradient method is generated for each argument:\n\nback(::typeof(hypot), ::Type{Arg{1}}, dy, y, x1::Value{S}, x2::Value{T}) where {S,T} = (dy .* x1) ./ y\nback(::typeof(hypot), ::Type{Arg{2}}, dy, y, x1::Value{S}, x2::Value{T}) where {S,T} = (dy .* x2) ./ y\n\nIn fact @primitive generates four more definitions for the other boxed/unboxed argument combinations.\n\nBroadcasting\n\nBroadcasting is handled by extra forw and back methods. @primitive defines the following  so that broadcasting of a primitive function with a boxed value triggers forw and back.\n\nbroadcasted(::typeof(sin), x::Value{T}) where {T<:Number} = forw(broadcasted,sin,x)\nback(::typeof(broadcasted), ::Type{Arg{2}}, dy, y, ::typeof(sin), x::Value{T}) where {T<:Number} = dy .* cos(x)\n\nIf you do not want the broadcasting methods, you can use the @primitive1 macro. If you only want the broadcasting methods use @primitive2. As a motivating example, here is how * is defined for non-scalars:\n\n@primitive1 *(x1,x2),dy  (dy*x2')  (x1'*dy)\n@primitive2 *(x1,x2),dy  unbroadcast(x1,dy.*x2)  unbroadcast(x2,x1.*dy)\n\nRegular * is matrix multiplication, broadcasted * is elementwise multiplication and the two have different gradients as defined above. unbroadcast(a,b) reduces b to the same shape as a by performing the necessary summations.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"macro"},{"location":"reference/#AutoGrad.@zerograd","page":"Reference","title":"AutoGrad.@zerograd","text":"@zerograd f(args...; kwargs...)\n\nDefine f as an AutoGrad primitive operation with zero gradient.\n\nExample:\n\n@zerograd  floor(x::Float32)\n\n@zerograd allows f to handle boxed Value inputs by unboxing them like a @primitive, but unlike @primitive it does not record its actions or return a boxed Value result. Some functions, like sign(), have zero gradient.  Others, like length() have discrete or constant outputs.

In this section we summarize common patterns of usage in recent work based on (Karpathy, 2016).","category":"page"},{"location":"cnn/","page":"Convolutional Neural Networks","title":"Convolutional Neural Networks","text":"The operations in convolutional networks are usually ordered into   several layers of convolution-bias-activation-pooling sequences.   Note that the convolution-bias-activation sequence is an efficient   way to implement the common neural net function f(wx+b) for a   locally connected and weight sharing hidden layer.\nThe convolutional layers are typically followed by a number of fully   connected layers that end with a softmax layer for prediction (if we   are training for a classification problem).\nIt is preferrable to have multiple convolution layers with small   filter sizes rather than a single layer with a large filter size.   Consider three convolutional layers with a filter size of   3x3. The units in the top layer have receptive fields of   size 7x7. Compare this with a single layer with a filter   size of 7x7. The three layer architecture has two   advantages: The units in the single layer network is restricted to   linear decision boundaries, whereas the three layer network can be   more expressive. Second, if we assume C channels, the parameter   tensor for the single layer network has size 77CC whereas the   three layer network has three tensors of size 33CC i.e. a   smaller number of parameters. The one disadvantage of the three   layer network is the extra storage required to store the   intermediate results for backpropagation.\nThus common settings for convolution use 3x3 filters with   stride = padding = 1 (which incidentally preserves the input   size). The one exception may be a larger filter size used in the   first layer which is applied to the image pixels. This will save   memory when the input is at its largest, and linear functions may be   sufficient to express the low level features at this stage.\nThe pooling operation may not be present in every layer. Keep in   mind that pooling destroys information and having several   convolutional layers without pooling may allow more complex features   to be learnt. When pooling is present it is best to keep the window   size small to minimize information loss. The common settings for   pooling are window = stride = 2, padding = 0, which halves the   input size in each dimension.","category":"page"},{"location":"cnn/","page":"Convolutional Neural Networks","title":"Convolutional Neural Networks","text":"Beyond these general guidelines, you should look at the architectures used by successful models in the literature.
