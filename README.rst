`Knet <http://knet.rtfd.org>`__ (pronounced "kay-net") is the `Ko√ß
University <http://www.ku.edu.tr/en>`__ deep learning framework
implemented in `Julia <http://julia.rtfd.org>`__ by `Deniz Yuret
<http://www.denizyuret.com>`__ and collaborators.  Unlike gradient
generating compilers like Theano and TensorFlow which force users into
a restricted mini-language, Knet allows the definition and training of
machine learning models using the full power and expressivity of
Julia.  Models are defined by describing only the forward calculation
in plain Julia allowing helper functions, loops, conditionals,
recursion, closures, tuples and dictionaries, array indexing and
concatenation and almost everything else Julia offers. High
performance is achieved by combining automatic differentiation of most
of Julia with efficient GPU kernels and memory management. The
computations can be performed on the GPU by simply using KnetArray
instead of Array for parameters and data.  Check out the `full
documentation <http://knet.rtfd.org>`__ (in progress) and the
`examples directory
<https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/tree/master/examples>`__ for
more information.

Installation
------------

You can install Knet using ``Pkg.add("Knet")``. Some of the examples
use additional packages such as ArgParse, GZip, and JLD. These are not
required by Knet and are installed automatically when needed.  See the
detailed `installation instructions
<http://knet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#installation>`__
as well as the section on `using Amazon AWS
<http://knet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#using-amazon-aws>`__
to experiment with GPU machines on the cloud with pre-installed Knet
images.

Examples
--------

In Knet, a machine learning model is defined using plain Julia code. A
typical model consists of a *prediction* and a *loss* function. The
prediction function takes model parameters and some input, returns the
prediction of the model for that input. The loss function measures how
bad the prediction is with respect to some desired output. We train a
model by adjusting its parameters to reduce the loss. In this section we
will see the prediction, loss, and training functions for five models:
linear regression, softmax classification, fully-connected,
convolutional and recurrent neural networks.

Linear regression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the prediction function and the corresponding quadratic loss
function for a simple linear regression model:

::

    predict(w,x) = w[1]*x .+ w[2]

    loss(w,x,y) = sumabs2(y - predict(w,x)) / size(y,2)

The variable ``w`` is a list of parameters (it could be a Tuple,
Array, or Dict), ``x`` is the input and ``y`` is the desired
output. To train this model, we want to adjust its parameters to
reduce the loss on given training examples. The direction in the
parameter space in which the loss reduction is maximum is given by the
negative gradient of the loss. Knet uses the higher-order function
``grad`` from `AutoGrad.jl
<https://github.com/denizyuret/AutoGrad.jl>`__ to compute the gradient
direction:

::

    using Knet

    lossgradient = grad(loss)

Note that ``grad`` is a higher-order function that takes and returns
other functions. The ``lossgradient`` function takes the same arguments
as ``loss``, e.g. ``dw = lossgradient(w,x,y)``. Instead of returning a
loss value, ``lossgradient`` returns ``dw``, the gradient of the loss
with respect to its first argument ``w``. The type and size of ``dw`` is
identical to ``w``, each entry in ``dw`` gives the derivative of the
loss with respect to the corresponding entry in ``w``. See ``@doc grad``
for more information.

Given some training ``data = [(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...]``, here is how we can
train this model:

::

    function train(w, data; lr=.1)
        for (x,y) in data
            dw = lossgradient(w, x, y)
            for i in 1:length(w)
                w[i] -= lr * dw[i]
            end
        end
        return w
    end

We simply iterate over the input-output pairs in data, calculate the
lossgradient for each example, and move the parameters in the negative
gradient direction with a step size determined by the learning rate
``lr``.

.. image:: https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/docs/images/housing.jpeg?raw=true
   :target: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing

Let's train this model on the
`Housing <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing>`__ dataset
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

::

    julia> url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.data"
    julia> rawdata = readdlm(download(url))
    julia> x = rawdata[:,1:13]'
    julia> x = (x .- mean(x,2)) ./ std(x,2)
    julia> y = rawdata[:,14:14]'
    julia> w = Any[ 0.1*randn(1,13), 0 ]
    julia> for i=1:10; train(w, [(x,y)]); println(loss(w,x,y)); end
    366.0463078055053
    ...
    29.63709385230451

The dataset has housing related information for 506 neighborhoods in
Boston from 1978. Each neighborhood is represented using 13 attributes
such as crime rate or distance to employment centers. The goal is to
predict the median value of the houses given in $1000's. After
downloading, splitting and normalizing the data, we initialize the
parameters randomly and take 10 steps in the negative gradient
direction. We can see the loss dropping from 366.0 to 29.6. See
`housing.jl
<https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/examples/housing.jl>`__
for more information on this example.

Note that ``grad`` was the only function used that is not in the Julia
standard library. This is typical of models defined in Knet.

Softmax classification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example we build a simple classification model for the
`MNIST <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist>`__ handwritten digit
recognition dataset. MNIST has 60000 training and 10000 test examples.
Each input x consists of 784 pixels representing a 28x28 image. The
corresponding output indicates the identity of the digit 0..9.

.. image:: https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/docs/images/firsteightimages.jpg?raw=true
   :target: https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2014/06/10/working-with-the-mnist-image-recognition-data-set
(`image source <https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2014/06/10/working-with-the-mnist-image-recognition-data-set>`__)

Classification models handle discrete outputs, as opposed to regression
models which handle numeric outputs. We typically use the cross entropy
loss function in classification models:

::

    function loss(w,x,ygold)
        ypred = predict(w,x)
        ynorm = ypred .- log(sum(exp(ypred),1))
        -sum(ygold .* ynorm) / size(ygold,2)
    end

Other than the change of loss function, the softmax model is identical
to the linear regression model. We use the same ``predict``, same
``train`` and set ``lossgradient=grad(loss)`` as before. To see how well
our model classifies let's define an ``accuracy`` function which returns
the percentage of instances classified correctly:

::

    function accuracy(w, data)
        ncorrect = ninstance = 0
        for (x, ygold) in data
            ypred = predict(w,x)
            ncorrect += sum(ygold .* (ypred .== maximum(ypred,1)))
            ninstance += size(ygold,2)
        end
        return ncorrect/ninstance
    end

Now let's train a model on the MNIST data:

::

    julia> include(Pkg.dir("Knet/examples/mnist.jl"))
    julia> using MNIST: xtrn, ytrn, xtst, ytst, minibatch
    julia> dtrn = minibatch(xtrn, ytrn, 100)
    julia> dtst = minibatch(xtst, ytst, 100)
    julia> w = Any[ -0.1+0.2*rand(Float32,10,784), zeros(Float32,10,1) ]
    julia> println((:epoch, 0, :trn, accuracy(w,dtrn), :tst, accuracy(w,dtst)))
    julia> for epoch=1:10
               train(w, dtrn; lr=0.5)
               println((:epoch, epoch, :trn, accuracy(w,dtrn), :tst, accuracy(w,dtst)))
           end

    (:epoch,0,:trn,0.11761667f0,:tst,0.121f0)
    (:epoch,1,:trn,0.9005f0,:tst,0.9048f0)
    ...
    (:epoch,10,:trn,0.9196f0,:tst,0.9153f0)

Including ``mnist.jl`` loads the MNIST data, downloading it from the
internet if necessary, and provides a training set (xtrn,ytrn), test set
(xtst,ytst) and a ``minibatch`` utility which we use to rearrange the
data into chunks of 100 instances. After randomly initializing the
parameters we train for 10 epochs, printing out training and test set
accuracy at every epoch. The final accuracy of about 92% is close to the
limit of what we can achieve with this type of model. To improve further
we must look beyond linear models.

Multi-layer perceptron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A multi-layer perceptron, i.e. a fully connected feed-forward neural
network, is basically a bunch of linear regression models stuck together
with non-linearities in between. 

.. image:: https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/docs/images/neural_net2.jpeg?raw=true
   :target: http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1
   :width: 60%
(`image source <http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1>`__)

We can define a MLP by slightly modifying the predict function:

::

    function predict(w,x)
        for i=1:2:length(w)-2
            x = max(0, w[i]*x .+ w[i+1])
        end
        return w[end-1]*x .+ w[end]
    end

Here ``w[2k-1]`` is the weight matrix and ``w[2k]`` is the bias vector
for the k'th layer. max(0,a) implements the popular rectifier
non-linearity. Note that if w only has two entries, this is equivalent
to the linear and softmax models. By adding more entries to w, we can
define multi-layer perceptrons of arbitrary depth. Let's define one with
a single hidden layer of 64 units:

::

    w = Any[ -0.1+0.2*rand(Float32,64,784), zeros(Float32,64,1),
             -0.1+0.2*rand(Float32,10,64),  zeros(Float32,10,1) ]

The rest of the code is the same as the softmax model. We use the same
cross-entropy loss function and the same training script. The code for
this example is available in
`mnist.jl <https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/examples/mnist.jl>`__.
The multi-layer perceptron does significantly better than the softmax
model:

::

    (:epoch,0,:trn,0.10166667f0,:tst,0.0977f0)
    (:epoch,1,:trn,0.9389167f0,:tst,0.9407f0)
    ...
    (:epoch,10,:trn,0.9866f0,:tst,0.9735f0)

Convolutional neural network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve the performance further, we can use a convolutional neural
networks (CNN).  See the `course notes
<http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/>`__ by Andrej
Karpathy for a good introduction to CNNs. We will implement the `LeNet
<http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet>`__ model which consists of two
convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layers.

.. image:: https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/docs/images/le_net.png?raw=true
   :target: http://www.dataiku.com/blog/2015/08/18/Deep_Learning.html
(`image source <http://www.dataiku.com/blog/2015/08/18/Deep_Learning.html>`__)

Knet provides the ``conv4(w,x)`` and ``pool(x)`` functions for the
implementation of convolutional nets (see ``@doc conv4`` and ``@doc
pool`` for details):

::

    function predict(w,x0)
        x1 = pool(max(0, conv4(w[1],x0) .+ w[2]))
        x2 = pool(max(0, conv4(w[3],x1) .+ w[4]))
        x3 = max(0, w[5]*mat(x2) .+ w[6])
        return w[7]*x3 .+ w[8]
    end

The weights for the convolutional net can be initialized as follows:

::

    w = Any[ -0.1+0.2*rand(Float32,5,5,1,20),  zeros(Float32,1,1,20,1),
             -0.1+0.2*rand(Float32,5,5,20,50), zeros(Float32,1,1,50,1),
             -0.1+0.2*rand(Float32,500,800),   zeros(Float32,500,1),
             -0.1+0.2*rand(Float32,10,500),    zeros(Float32,10,1) ]

Currently convolution and pooling are only supported on the GPU for 4-D
and 5-D arrays. So we reshape our data and transfer it to the GPU along
with the parameters by converting them into KnetArrays (see
``@doc KnetArray`` for more information):

::

    dtrn = map(d->(KnetArray(reshape(d[1],(28,28,1,100))), KnetArray(d[2])), dtrn)
    dtst = map(d->(KnetArray(reshape(d[1],(28,28,1,100))), KnetArray(d[2])), dtst)
    w = map(KnetArray, w)

The training proceeds as before giving us even better results. The code
for the LeNet example can be found in
`lenet.jl <https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/examples/lenet.jl>`__.

::

    (:epoch,0,:trn,0.12215f0,:tst,0.1263f0)
    (:epoch,1,:trn,0.96963334f0,:tst,0.971f0)
    ...
    (:epoch,10,:trn,0.99553335f0,:tst,0.9879f0)

Recurrent neural network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we will see how to implement a recurrent neural network
(RNN) in Knet. An RNN is a class of neural network where connections
between units form a directed cycle, which allows them to keep a
persistent state over time. This gives them the ability to process
sequences of arbitrary length one element at a time, while keeping track
of what happened at previous elements. 

.. image:: https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/docs/images/RNN-unrolled.png?raw=true
   :target: http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs
(`image source <http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs>`__)

As an example, we will build a character-level language model inspired
by `"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks"
<http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness>`__ from the
Andrej Karpathy blog. The model can be trained with different genres
of text, and can be used to generate original text in the same style.

It turns out simple RNNs are not very good at remembering things for a
very long time. Currently the most popular solution is to use a more
complicated unit like the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). An LSTM
controls the information flow into and out of the unit using gates
similar to digital circuits and can model long term dependencies. See
`Understanding LSTM
Networks <http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs>`__
by Christopher Olah for a good overview of LSTMs.

.. image:: https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/docs/images/LSTM3-chain.png?raw=true
   :target: http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs
(`image source <http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs>`__)

The code below shows one way to define an LSTM in Knet. The first two
arguments are the parameters, the weight matrix and the bias vector. The
next two arguments hold the internal state of the LSTM: the hidden and
cell arrays. The last argument is the input. Note that for performance
reasons we lump all the parameters of the LSTM into one matrix-vector
pair instead of using separate parameters for each gate. This way we can
perform a single matrix multiplication, and recover the gates using
array indexing. We represent input, hidden and cell as row vectors
rather than column vectors for more efficient concatenation and
indexing. ``sigm`` and ``tanh`` are the sigmoid and the hyperbolic
tangent activation functions. The LSTM returns the updated state
variables ``hidden`` and ``cell``.

::

    function lstm(weight,bias,hidden,cell,input)
        gates   = hcat(input,hidden) * weight .+ bias
        hsize   = size(hidden,2)
        forget  = sigm(gates[:,1:hsize])
        ingate  = sigm(gates[:,1+hsize:2hsize])
        outgate = sigm(gates[:,1+2hsize:3hsize])
        change  = tanh(gates[:,1+3hsize:end])
        cell    = cell .* forget + ingate .* change
        hidden  = outgate .* tanh(cell)
        return (hidden,cell)
    end

The LSTM has an input gate, forget gate and an output gate that control
information flow. Each gate depends on the current ``input`` value, and
the last hidden state ``hidden``. The memory value ``cell`` is computed
by blending a new value ``change`` with the old ``cell`` value under the
control of input and forget gates. The output gate decides how much of
the ``cell`` is shared with the outside world.

If an input gate element is close to 0, the corresponding element in the
new ``input`` will have little effect on the memory cell. If a forget
gate element is close to 1, the contents of the corresponding memory
cell can be preserved for a long time. Thus the LSTM has the ability to
pay attention to the current input, or reminisce in the past, and it can
learn when to do which based on the problem.

To build a language model, we need to predict the next character in a
piece of text given the current character and recent history as encoded
in the internal state. The ``predict`` function below implements a
multi-layer LSTM model. ``s[2k-1:2k]`` hold the hidden and cell arrays
and ``w[2k-1:2k]`` hold the weight and bias parameters for the k'th LSTM
layer. The last three elements of ``w`` are the embedding matrix and the
weight/bias for the final prediction. ``predict`` takes the current
character encoded in ``x`` as a one-hot row vector, multiplies it with
the embedding matrix, passes it through a number of LSTM layers, and
converts the output of the final layer to the same number of dimensions
as the input using a linear transformation. The state variable ``s`` is
modified in-place.

::

    function predict(w, s, x)
        x = x * w[end-2]
        for i = 1:2:length(s)
            (s[i],s[i+1]) = lstm(w[i],w[i+1],s[i],s[i+1],x)
            x = s[i]
        end
        return x * w[end-1] .+ w[end]
    end

To train the language model we will use Backpropagation Through Time
(BPTT) which basically means running the network on a given sequence and
updating the parameters based on the total loss. Here is a function that
calculates the total cross-entropy loss for a given (sub)sequence:

::

    function loss(param,state,sequence,range=1:length(sequence)-1)
        total = 0.0; count = 0
        atype = typeof(getval(param[1]))
        input = convert(atype,sequence[first(range)])
        for t in range
            ypred = predict(param,state,input)
            ynorm = logp(ypred,2) # ypred .- log(sum(exp(ypred),2))
            ygold = convert(atype,sequence[t+1])
            total += sum(ygold .* ynorm)
            count += size(ygold,1)
            input = ygold
        end
        return -total / count
    end

Here ``param`` and ``state`` hold the parameters and the state of the
model, ``sequence`` and ``range`` give us the input sequence and a
possible range over it to process. We convert the entries in the
sequence to inputs that have the same type as the parameters one at a
time (to conserve GPU memory). We use each token in the given range as
an input to predict the next token. The average cross-entropy loss per
token is returned.

To generate text we sample each character randomly using the
probabilities predicted by the model based on the previous character:

::

    function generate(param, state, vocab, nchar)
        index_to_char = Array(Char, length(vocab))
        for (k,v) in vocab; index_to_char[v] = k; end
        input = oftype(param[1], zeros(1,length(vocab)))
        index = 1
        for t in 1:nchar
            ypred = predict(param,state,input)
            input[index] = 0
            index = sample(exp(logp(ypred)))
            print(index_to_char[index])
            input[index] = 1
        end
        println()
    end

Here ``param`` and ``state`` hold the parameters and state variables as
usual. ``vocab`` is a Char->Int dictionary of the characters that can be
produced by the model, and ``nchar`` gives the number of characters to
generate. We initialize the input as a zero vector and use ``predict``
to predict subsequent characters. ``sample`` picks a random index based
on the normalized probabilities output by the model.

At this point we can train the network on any given piece of text (or
other discrete sequence). For efficiency it is best to minibatch the
training data and run BPTT on small subsequences. See
`charlm.jl <https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/examples/charlm.jl>`__
for details. Here is a sample run on 'The Complete Works of William
Shakespeare':

<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing>`__, `MNIST
<http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist>`__, `Hiawatha
<http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19/19.txt>`__. The MLP uses a single
hidden layer of 64 units.  CharLM uses a single layer LSTM language
model with embedding and hidden layer sizes set to 256 and trained
using BPTT with a sequence length of 100. Each dataset was minibatched
and transferred to GPU prior to benchmarking when possible.


Function reference
------------------

We implement machine learning models in Knet using regular Julia code
and the ``grad`` function.  Knet defines a few more utility functions
listed below.  See ``@doc <function>`` for full details.

============= ==========
``grad``      returns the gradient function.
``KnetArray`` constructs a GPU array.
``gradcheck`` compares gradients with numeric approximations.
``Knet.dir``  returns a path relative to Knet root.
``gpu``       determines which GPU Knet uses.
``relu``      returns ``max(0,x)``
``sigm``      returns ``(1./(1+exp(-x)))``
``invx``      returns ``(1./x)``
``logp``      returns ``x .- log(sum(exp(x),[dims]))``
``logsumexp`` returns ``log(sum(exp(x),[dims]))``
``conv4``     executes convolutions or cross-correlations.
``pool``      replaces several adjacent values with their mean or maximum.
``mat``       reshapes its input into a two-dimensional matrix.
``update!``   updates the weight depending on the gradient and the parameters of the optimization method
============= ==========

Optimization methods
--------------------

In the examples above, we used simple SGD as the optimization method and performed parameter updates manually using ``w[i] -= lr * dw[i]``.  The ``update!`` function provides more optimization methods and can be used in place of this manual update.  In addition to a weight array ``w[i]`` and its gradient ``dw[i]``, ``update!`` requires a third argument encapsulating the type, options, and state of the optimization method.  The constructors of the supported optimization methods are listed below.  See ``@doc Sgd`` etc. for full details.  Note that in general we need to keep one of these state variables per weight array, see `optimizers.jl <https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/examples/optimizers.jl>`__ for example usage.

============= ==========
``Sgd``       encapsulates learning rate
``Momentum``  encapsulates learning rate, gamma and velocity
``Adam``      encapsualtes learning rate, beta1, beta2, epsilon, time, first and second moments
``Adagrad``   encapsualtes learning rate, epsilon and accumulated gradients (G)
``Adadelta``  encapsulates learning rate, rho, epsilon, accumulated gradients (G) and updates (delta)
``Rmsprop``   encapsulates learning rate, rho, epsilon and accumulated gradients (G)
============= ==========


Under the hood
--------------

Knet relies on the `AutoGrad
<https://github.com/denizyuret/AutoGrad.jl>`__ package and the
`KnetArray
<https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/src/karray.jl>`__
data type for its functionality and performance.  AutoGrad computes
the gradient of Julia functions and KnetArray implements high
performance GPU arrays with custom memory management. This section
briefly describes them.

AutoGrad
~~~~~~~~

As we have seen, many common machine learning models can be expressed as differentiable programs that input parameters and data and output a scalar loss value.
The loss value measures how close the model predictions are to desired values with the given parameters.  
Training a model can then be seen as an optimization problem: find the parameters that minimize the loss.  
Typically, a gradient based optimization algorithm is used for computational efficiency: the direction in the parameter space in which the loss reduction is maximum is given by the negative gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters. 
Thus gradient computations take a central stage in software frameworks for machine learning.
In this section I will briefly outline existing gradient computation techniques and motivate the particular approach taken by Knet.

Computation of gradients in computer models is performed by four main
methods `(Baydin et al. 2015) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05767>`__:

* manual differentiation (programming the derivatives)
* numerical differentiation (using finite difference approximations)
* symbolic differentiation (using expression manipulation)
* automatic differentiation (detailed below)

Manually taking derivatives and coding the result is labor intensive,
error-prone, and all but impossible with complex deep learning models.
Numerical differentiation is simple:
:math:`f'(x)=(f(x+\epsilon)-f(x-\epsilon))/(2\epsilon)` but
impractical: the finite difference equation needs to be evaluated for
each individual parameter, of which there are typically many.  Pure
symbolic differentiation using expression manipulation, as implemented
in software such as Maxima, Maple, and Mathematica is impractical for
different reasons: (i) it may not be feasible to express a machine
learning model as a closed form mathematical expression, and (ii) the
symbolic derivative can be exponentially larger than the model itself
leading to inefficient run-time calculation.  This leaves us with
automatic differentiation.

Automatic differentiation is the idea of using symbolic derivatives
only at the level of elementary operations, and computing the gradient
of a compound function by applying the chain rule to intermediate
numerical results.  For example, pure symbolic differentiation of
:math:`\sin^2(x)` could give us :math:`2\sin(x)\cos(x)` directly.
Automatic differentiation would use the intermediate numerical values
:math:`x_1=\sin(x)`, :math:`x_2=x_1^2` and the elementary derivatives
:math:`dx_2/dx_1=2x_1`, :math:`dx_1/dx=\cos(x)` to compute the same
answer without ever building a full gradient expression.

To implement automatic differentiation the target function needs to be
decomposed into its elementary operations, a process similar to
compilation.  Most machine learning frameworks (such as Theano, Torch,
Caffe, Tensorflow and older versions of Knet prior to v0.8) compile
models expressed in a restricted mini-language into a computational
graph of elementary operations that have pre-defined derivatives.
There are two drawbacks with this approach: (i) the restricted
mini-languages tend to have limited support for high-level language
features such as conditionals, loops, helper functions, array
indexing, etc. (e.g. the infamous ``scan`` operation in Theano) (ii)
the sequence of elementary operations that unfold at run-time needs to
be known in advance, and they are difficult to handle when the
sequence is data dependent.

There is an alternative: high-level languages, like Julia and Python,
already know how to decompose functions into their elementary
operations.  If we let the users define their models directly in a
high-level language, then record the elementary operations during loss
calculation at run-time, the computational graph can be constructed
from the recorded operations. The cost of recording is not
prohibitive: The table below gives cumulative times for elementary
operations of an MLP with quadratic loss. Recording only adds 15\% to
the raw cost of the forward computation. Backpropagation roughly
doubles the total time as expected.

================== ====
op                 secs
================== ====
``a1=w1*x``        0.67
``a2=w2.+a1``      0.71
``a3=max(0,a2)``   0.75
``a4=w3*a3``       0.81
``a5=w4.+a4``      0.85
``a6=a5-y``        0.89
``a7=sumabs2(a6)`` 1.18
+recording         1.33
+backprop          2.79
================== ====

This is the approach taken by the popular `autograd
<https://github.com/HIPS/autograd>`__ Python package and its Julia
port `AutoGrad.jl <https://github.com/denizyuret/AutoGrad.jl>`__ used
by Knet.  In these implementations ``g=grad(f)`` generates a gradient
function ``g``, which takes the same inputs as the function ``f`` but
returns the gradient.  The gradient function ``g`` triggers recording
by boxing the parameters in a special data type and calls ``f``.  The
elementary operations in ``f`` are overloaded to record their actions
and output boxed answers when their inputs are boxed. The sequence of
recorded operations is then used to compute gradients. In the Julia
AutoGrad package, derivatives can be defined independently for each
method of a function (determined by argument types) making full use of
Julia's multiple dispatch.  New elementary operations and derivatives
can be defined concisely using Julia's macro and meta-programming
facilities.  See `AutoGrad.jl
<https://github.com/denizyuret/AutoGrad.jl>`__ for details.

KnetArray
~~~~~~~~~

GPUs have become indispensable for training large deep learning
models.  Even the small examples implemented here run up to 17x faster
on the GPU compared to the 8 core CPU architecture we use for
benchmarking.  However GPU implementations have a few potential
pitfalls: (i) GPU memory allocation is slow, (ii) GPU-RAM memory
transfer is slow, (iii) reduction operations (like ``sum``) can be
very slow unless implemented properly (See `Optimizing Parallel
Reduction in CUDA
<http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/1.1-Beta/x86_website/projects/reduction/doc/reduction.pdf>`__).

Knet implements `KnetArray
<https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/src/karray.jl>`__
as a Julia data type that wraps GPU array pointers.  KnetArray is
based on the more standard `CudaArray
<https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDArt.jl>`__ with a few important
differences: (i) KnetArrays have a custom memory manager, similar to
`ArrayFire <http://arrayfire.com>`__, which reuse pointers garbage
collected by Julia to reduce the number of GPU memory
allocations, (ii) array ranges (e.g. ``a[:,3:5]``) are handled as
views with shared pointers instead of copies when possible, and (iii)
a number of custom CUDA kernels written for KnetArrays implement
element-wise, broadcasting, and scalar and vector reduction operations
efficiently.  As a result Knet allows users to implement their models
using high-level code, yet be competitive in performance with other
frameworks as demonstrated in the benchmarks section.
