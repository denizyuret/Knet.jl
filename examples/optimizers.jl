"""

This example demonstrates the usage of stochastic gradient descent(sgd) based
optimization methods. We train LeNet model on MNIST dataset similar to `lenet.jl`.

You can run the demo using `julia optimizers.jl`.  Use `julia optimizers.jl
--help` for a list of options. By default the [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet)
convolutional neural network model will be trained using sgd for 10 epochs.
At the end of the training accuracy for the training and test sets for each epoch will be printed 
and optimized parameters will be returned.
